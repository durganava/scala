# Chapter 2: Manipulating data with Breeze

This chapter introduces manipulating tabular data with Breeze. We use CSVs with the true and self-reported heights and weights for 181 men and women as an example dataset.

 * `HWData.scala`: helper routines for loading the height-weight data from CSVs.
 * `LogisticRegression.scala`: Re-usable Scala class implementing logistic regression.
 * `LogisticRegressionDemo.scala`: Example run for the Logistic regression class.

Type `$ sbt run` to run `LogisticRegressionDemo`. Type `sbt console` to get a Scala console pre-loaded with Breeze.
